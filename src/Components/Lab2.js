            content: `An ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used in networking to send error messages and operational information. For example, the command ping to check if a website is online, functions on ICMP.

So you may be asking, how does an Attack on ICMP work? An ICMP Redirect attack is one of the most common attacks performed on the web and networks. In this scenario, an attacker pretends to be a router and sends fake ICMP redirect messages to a target device. The device inherently believes the fake message and starts to reroute traffic from the real destination to the attacker's machine. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, and steal data before forwarding it to the real destination. An attacker can also just drop the traffic after processing it, causing a denial of service.`

            content: `ICMP redirect attacks can be used to steal sensitive information if an attacker has access to your Local Area Network (LAN). ICMP Redirect Attacks have been used to steal passwords, financial and banking information, and a plethora of other types of information in the internet's history. ICMP redirect Attacks can also be used as a gateway to siphon information to a malicious server for large scale data theft as well as set the stage for Man-in-the-middle Attacks. This lab aims to show you how ICMP Redirect Attacks work so that in your own work or career, you will be able to identify patterns and signatures associated with this specific attack and other web-based attacks.`
